Summary as of April 26, 2016

27530 Genes and isoforms total (15542 unique)
- CNS-CHS  1284 up 1308 down
- FNS-FHS 615 up 799 down
- CNS-FNS 396 up 250 down
- CHS-FHS 435 up 680 down

CNS-CHS
- trypsin and heat shock go way up
- Cuticle proteins go down also ???

FNS-FHS
- HSP go up and are mostly in the top 10
- immune genes (lebocin, etc) go down

CNS-FNS
- immune genes are way higher in FNS compared to CNS
- Some trypsin and lipase genes go down in FNS compared to CNS

CHS-FHS
- up- unsure still
- trypsin, chymotrypsin lipas etc are down regulated in FHS compared to CHS

Trypsin and other genes like it are only found to be highly expressed under CHS conditions.
